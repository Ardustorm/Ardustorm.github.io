  My name is Luke Thompson, I'm a 2nd year Computer Engineering major studying at California Poly Technic University.

  pe my life at the ripe old age of three? Well that’s exactly what happened. My parents understood my curiosity and gave me the freedom to explore. They let me have the audio console to take apart and I proceeded to disassemble it to see what was inside.  Ever since then I have been fascinated with how things work. Whenever something broke in our house, I would take it apart to learn more about it and see if I could fix it. This continuous opportunity for learning and exploration has lead me to my passion for learning. Whenever I would go to my grandmother’s house, we would do experiments. We would make rockets, look at organisms through a microscope, and we even took apart a toaster to see how it worked. My Grandmother continued to foster my curiosity and desire for knowledge.  
In middle school I decided I wanted to learn about robotics. Since I didn’t know anyone who could teach me, I started teaching myself through the use of the internet. I spent hours researching what tools and components I needed to get started. I continued investing time and energy to learn how to solder as well as the basics of electronics and programming. After learning coding, I attempted to program a PID algorithm for a line following robot. Despite the time I spent learning all of these new skills, I was unable to completely implement the full PID algorithm since I did not understand the prog
