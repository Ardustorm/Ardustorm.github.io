My name is Luke Thompson and I am passionate about problem solving and learning.

Who would have thoughts a screwdriver, safety goggles and an old audio console would shape my life at the ripe old age of three? Well that’s exactly what happened. My parents understood my curiosity and gave me the freedom to explore. They let me have the audio console to take apart and I proceeded to disassemble it to see what was inside.  Ever since then I have been fascinated with how things work. Whenever something broke in our house, I would take it apart to learn more about it and see if I could fix it. This continuous opportunity for learning and exploration has lead me to my passion for learning. Whenever I would go to my grandmother’s house, we would do experiments. We would make rockets, look at organisms through a microscope, and we even took apart a toaster to see how it worked. My Grandmother continued to foster my curiosity and desire for knowledge.

In middle school I decided I wanted to learn about robotics. Since I didn’t know anyone who could teach me, I started teaching myself through the use of the internet. I spent hours researching what tools and components I needed to get started. I continued investing time and energy to learn how to solder as well as the basics of electronics and programming. After learning coding, I attempted to program a PID algorithm for a line following robot. Despite the time I spent learning all of these new skills, I was unable to completely implement the full PID algorithm since I did not understand the programming errors. Although my parents were supportive throughout the whole process, they were unable to help me with the technicalities because they did not understand it themselves. Even though they helped cultivate my desire for knowledge and my ability to teach myself,  I could only go so far without help from others.

In High School, I stumbled across a place called the Tech Academy. It provided kids with a place to learn about robotics with the help of instructors. It was in this environment that I was able to ask questions and get guidance from people who were experienced in robotics. I was able to grow and expand my knowledge, eventually mastering the PID line following robot that I had originally attempted in middle school. I am now working with some of these same instructors, to build and program a completely autonomous submarine for an international competition called Robosub. I still have the curiosity and passion for learning  that I had when I was three but now I’m actually able to put things back together (at least most of the time).
